# Detecting plagiarism using cosine similarity
Detecting plagiarism using cosine similarity involves comparing the similarity of two documents based on the cosine of the angle between their vector representations. This method is widely used in natural language processing and information retrieval to measure the similarity between documents. The process begins by representing each document as a vector in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a unique term or word.

The formula for cosine similarity between two vectors, A and B, is given by the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes:

\[ \text{Cosine Similarity}(A, B) = \frac{{A \cdot B}}{{\|A\| \|B\|}} \]

To visually understand this, consider two vectors in a two-dimensional space representing the term frequency of words in each document. The cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between these vectors, and it ranges from -1 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (identical). A higher cosine similarity indicates greater similarity between the documents.


In the context of plagiarism detection, a corpus of documents is preprocessed, and the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representation is often used to capture the importance of terms in each document. The TF-IDF vectorization enhances the performance of cosine similarity by giving more weight to terms that are unique and informative in a particular document.


Plagiarism detection systems apply these principles by comparing the cosine similarity scores of a suspicious document against a set of reference documents. If the similarity score surpasses a predefined threshold, the document may be flagged for further review. This method is powerful in identifying textual similarities while being adaptable to various document types and languages, making it a valuable tool in the fight against plagiarism.
